🌍 Introducing Weather Finder: Your Real-Time Weather Companion 🌦️

I’m excited to share my latest project – a weather app built with React.js that allows users to get real-time weather information for any city around the world! 🌡️

🔹 Technologies Used:

React.js for dynamic user interface
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the structure and interactivity
Bootstrap for responsive design
Weather API for fetching live weather data
Whether you're planning your day or just curious about the weather anywhere, Weather Finder provides quick, accurate, and easy-to-read weather updates. 🌤️
